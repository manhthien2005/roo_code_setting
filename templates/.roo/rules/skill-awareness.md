## Project Skills (installed to <workspace>/.roo/)

| Skill | Trigger Condition | Mandatory? |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| `coding-standards` | After every code change in Code mode (checks WHAT) | ✅ YES |
| `context-budget` | When conversation grows long (>20 tool calls) | ✅ YES |
| `context-checkpoint` | When context >70%, save progress to file | Optional |
| `search-first` | Before creating new files or functions in Code mode | ✅ YES |
| `project-context` | When opening new project or user requests | Optional |
| `continuous-learning` | End of complex sessions (>50 tool calls) | Optional |
| `workspace-audit` | When user requests audit or after config changes | Optional |

## Overlap Notes
- `coding-standards` (project, WHAT to check) + `lint-and-validate` (global, HOW to run tools) = complementary, both trigger on code change
- `context-checkpoint` (project, reactive) ≠ `planning-with-files` (global, proactive) = different triggers
- `systematic-debugging` (global skill) delegates from `rules-debug/systematic-debugging.md` (rule)

## Related Rules
- `reasoning-optimization.md` — extended thinking & reasoning effort guidance (not a skill, always loaded as rule)

## Rules
- DO NOT skip mandatory skills. They exist to prevent errors.
- If a skill applies, follow its instructions COMPLETELY before proceeding.
- When multiple skills could match, prefer the most specific one.
