# Writing Skills (Excellence)

Dispatcher for skill creation excellence. Use the decision tree below to find the right template and standards.

Respond in the user's configured language.

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

### What do you need to do?

1. **Create a NEW skill:**
   - Is it simple (single file, <200 lines)? → [Tier 1 Architecture](references/tier-1-simple/README.md)
   - Is it complex (multi-concept, 200-1000 lines)? → [Tier 2 Architecture](references/tier-2-expanded/README.md)
   - Is it a massive platform (10+ products, AWS, Convex)? → [Tier 3 Architecture](references/tier-3-platform/README.md)

2. **Improve an EXISTING skill:**
   - Fix "it's too long" -> [Modularize (Tier 3)](references/templates/tier-3-platform.md)
   - Fix "AI ignores rules" -> [Anti-Rationalization](references/anti-rationalization/README.md)
   - Fix "users can't find it" -> [CSO (Search Optimization)](references/cso/README.md)

3. **Verify Compliance:**
   - Check metadata/naming -> [Standards](references/standards/README.md)
   - Add tests -> [Testing Guide](references/testing/README.md)

## 📚 Component Index

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **[CSO](references/cso/README.md)** | "SEO for LLMs". How to write descriptions that trigger. |
| **[Standards](references/standards/README.md)** | File naming, YAML frontmatter, directory structure. |
| **[Anti-Rationalization](references/anti-rationalization/README.md)**| How to write rules that agents won't ignore. |
| **[Testing](references/testing/README.md)** | How to ensure your skill actually works. |

## 🛠️ Templates

- [Technique Skill](references/templates/technique.md) (How-to)
- [Reference Skill](references/templates/reference.md) (Docs)
- [Discipline Skill](references/templates/discipline.md) (Rules)
- [Pattern Skill](references/templates/pattern.md) (Design Patterns)

## When to Use
- Creating a NEW skill from scratch
- Improving an EXISTING skill that agents ignore
- Debugging why a skill isn't being triggered
- Standardizing skills across a team

## How It Works

1. **Identify goal** → Use decision tree above
2. **Select template** → From `references/templates/`
3. **Apply CSO** → Optimize description for discovery
4. **Add anti-rationalization** → For discipline skills
5. **Test** → RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

## Quick Example

```yaml
---
name: my-technique
description: "Use when [specific symptom occurs]."
risk: safe
source: self
tags: [category, keyword1, keyword2]
---

# My Technique

## When to Use
- [Symptom A]
- [Error message]
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Description summarizes workflow | Use "Use when..." triggers only |
| No `tags` in frontmatter | Add 3+ keyword tags |
| Generic name ("helper") | Use gerund (`creating-skills`) |
| Long monolithic SKILL.md | Split into `references/` |

See [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) for more.

## ✅ Pre-Deploy Checklist

Before deploying any skill:

- [ ] `name` field matches directory name exactly
- [ ] `SKILL.md` filename is ALL CAPS
- [ ] Description is <200 chars, starts with verb or "Use when..."
- [ ] `tags` has 3+ keywords
- [ ] `risk` is set (`safe` or `moderate`)
- [ ] Total lines < 500 (use `references/` for more)
- [ ] No `@` force-loading in cross-references
- [ ] Tested with real scenarios
